% Total number of glyphs: 107
%
% Next larger glyph set: Adobe Cyrillic 2, 155 glyphs
%
% The core of this set, which became the basis of the Cyrillic block in the Unicode 
% Standard and the character set used in Minion Cyrillic (Type 1), was defined by 
% David Birnbaum (Slavic) and Thomas Milo (Turkic and other non-Slavic former Soviet 
% languages) who worked for Bur Davis (Adobe US) and Tony Arcari (Adobe Europe). 
% Thomas Milo's report written between 1988 and 1990. This core was later complemented 
% by seven characters Ѣ, ѣ, Ѳ, ѳ, Ѵ, ѵ, ә, and became the character set supported by 
% most of our (Type 1 and Std/Pro) families with Cyrillic support. 
% While defining the Adobe Cyrillic 1character set, four more characters were added: 
% Ѐ, Ѝ, ѐ, ѝ. The character ә was not included in Adobe Cyrillic 1 because it's only 
% used in languages that require additional characters not covered by this 
% character set. The Ukrainian hryvnia (₴ ) and the Russian ruble (₽ ) were also 
% added later.
% 
% Adobe at some point (around 2010?) switched its glyph naming scheme for many Cyrillic 
% characters from afiiXXXX names to uniXXXX names.
%
% The languages covered by Adobe Cyrillic 1 are: Balkar, Belarusian (Cyrillic), 
% Bulgarian, Erzya, Karachay, Kumyk, Macedonian, Moksha, Nanai, Nogai, Russian, 
% Rusyn, Serbian (Cyrillic) and Ukrainian.
