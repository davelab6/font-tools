% Total number of glyphs: 155
%
% Number of glyphs added (to Adobe Cyrillic 1): 48
%
% Next larger glyph set: Adobe Cyrillic 3, 203/255 glyphs
%
% This character set is based on the analysis Thomas Phinney did of Cyrillic-based 
% languages, which results he posted on the Adobe blog at 
% http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/08/defining_an_ext.html. 
% The initial plan was to support all the languages up to Group D (inclusive) – 
% thus the sentence "That's everything we have tentatively decided to do." 
% "There are several more groups that we considered, but are not going to do at this time" 
% --, and that's what got included in Arno Pro (v1.011), the family being developed at 
% the time. In the meantime, while Thomas designed his own Hypatia Sans and as he
% concluded the analysis, he decided to support further groups because he considered 
% it was not too much additional work. Subsequently, Robert Slimbach based the 
% character sets of his new families (Adobe Clean, Adobe Clean Serif, Adobe Text) on 
% Hypatia's, and this way it became the de facto set.
%
% Adobe Cyrillic 2 supports three additional characters: Ӕ, ӕ (Group I), 
% and ₸ the Kazakhstani tenge (₸ ). However, after further analysis we decided 
% to drop the 4 characters (Ҝ, ҝ, Ҹ, ҹ ) belonging to Group H 
% (Azerbaijani/Azeri and Talysh); both these languages are not actively using 
% a Cyrillic alphabet, the characters are complicated to design, and they're not used 
% in any other language.
%
% The additional languages supported by Adobe Cyrillic 2 are: Abaza, Adyghe, Agul, 
% Avar, Bashkir, Buryat, Chechen, Chuvash, Crimean Tatar (Cyrillic), Dargin, Dungan, 
% Ingush, Kabardian, Kalmyk, Karakalpak, Kazakh, Khinalugh, Komi, Kyrgyz (Cyrillic), 
% Lak, Lezgian, Moldovan (Cyrillic), Mongolian (Cyrillic), Ossetian, Rutul, Tabasaran, 
% Tajik, Tat, Tatar, Turkmen, Tuvan, Uyghur (Cyrillic) and Uzbek (Cyrillic).
%
% This set includes the coverage from Adobe Cyrillic 1: Balkar, Belarusian (Cyrillic), 
% Bulgarian, Erzya, Karachay, Kumyk, Macedonian, Moksha, Nanai, Nogai, Russian, 
% Rusyn, Serbian (Cyrillic) and Ukrainian.
